## About this Module

The RDS Proxy is still new to AWS and as such the documentation is still catching up to it. There are a few unknowns that make it hard to build a fully independent module.

In addition, the Terraform integration is still incomplete.

Of note: there is nto completel documentation on what the service role needs to be. The role ARN is hard coded here and besed on one that was created in the custom-dev account through the CLI.
